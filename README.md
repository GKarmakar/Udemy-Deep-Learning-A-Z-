# Udemy-Deep-Learning-A-Z-
This is notebooks from excercises of Udemy Deep Learning A to Z course. This course is provided by Superdatacenter.com.
This courses teaches basic deep learning techniqes like Artificial Neural Network(ANN), Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent neural network. It also eludes you to more advanced topic such as Autoencoder and Restricted Boltzman Machine. But it doesn't try to teach you these advanced topics in this small course rather gives a motivation in case one wants to learn about them. It does gives a working practice on autoencode and restricted boltzman machine solution for movie recommendation using the famous GroupLens data.
But for basic deep learning using tensorflow this is really a good course. It explians concepts in few videos with examples really throughly and then solves a practical machine learning problem using tensorflow. It also uses sklearn wherever applicable.
One other good this about this course is that it also directs you to more materials, papers, tutorials as applicable to gain further knowledge. Overall, I would definitely give this course a try if I am newbie in deep learning. Enjoy!
